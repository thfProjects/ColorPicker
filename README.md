# ColorPicker
Android app that showcases a custom preference used for setting colors through a dialog with three SeekBars. Made for the needs of my NotificationTaskbar project

Built with Android Studio

Note: This project was aimed at developing the ColorSeekBarPreference module to be used with Notification Taskbar and this app itself was just used for testing.
